# Bicep-Curls-Count-Tracker
Contributed to the project along with a University senior.  
The project blends Machine Learning and Computer Vision to help a user count the number of Bicep Curls done.
It tracks various joints of the body of the user and looks for a certain angle of turn in the arms, thereby increasing the count for that arm by one.
It tracks both the arms separately, giving a better user experience.
A bar is displayed for each arm which shows the amount of turn by the arm.
