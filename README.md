# Bicep-Curls-Count-Tracker
The project blends Machine Learning and Computer Vision to help a user count the number of Bicep Curls done. It tracks various joints of the body of the user and looks for a certain angle of turn in the arms, thereby increasing the count for that arm by one. It tracks both the arms separately, giving a better user experience.
